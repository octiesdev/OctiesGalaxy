  "name": "Mellstrox",
  "description": "Mellstrox is one of the most influential and wealthy figures in the Octies Galaxy. His rise to power and fortune began on a ruined planet where he quickly realized that money could open any door and solve any problem. To him, wealth is the only true power that can control minds and fates, whether individuals or entire planets. He believes that everything and everyone has a price. Using his immense fortune, Mellstrox buys galactic corporations, mercenary armies, and even planets, aiming to prove that nothing matters more than money. Despite his ruthless pursuit of control, Mellstrox’s arrogance makes him vulnerable, unable to understand the true strength that lies in trust and unity. His endless resources make him a dangerous adversary, always offering the highest bid to sway even the most loyal heroes. Mellstrox’s goal is simple: to prove that absolutely everything can be bought, from loyalty to power. But can the galaxy’s heroes stop him before he owns everything?",
