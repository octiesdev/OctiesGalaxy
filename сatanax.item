  "description": "Catanax, a hybrid of Neophidian and feline origin, was once a brilliant scientist named Anorax. After a failed experiment led by Joknax, Catanax's body and mind were fused with a wild feline creature. Now, he possesses the agility and instincts of a cat, combined with the intelligence of his former self. Despite the inner conflict between his rational mind and primal urges, Catanax remains a valuable ally, seeking to reverse his condition while using his unique abilities to protect the galaxy.",
