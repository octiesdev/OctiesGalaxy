  "description": "The Joker’s past remains shrouded in mystery to this day, despite the character’s more than eighty-year history. However, there has been no official confirmation of the Joker’s origin. Many versions have been dismissed as either cover stories or lies about his past life, or lies claiming that he doesn’t know his own past. The Joker himself says about this: "Sometimes I remember one thing, sometimes another… After all, if I’m going to have a past, why limit it to just one? Ha-ha-ha!"",
