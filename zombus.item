  "name": "Zombus",
  "description": "Zombus was the result of a failed regeneration experiment intended to make him immortal. However, a malfunction in nanotechnology caused his body to decay, turning him into a half-zombie while preserving his consciousness and intellect. Despite his grim state, Zombus gained new abilities: defective regeneration, control over nanoparasites, and a connection with the dead. He met Octies when both were sent to the past to prevent a catastrophe. Instead of rejecting him, Octies helped Zombus adapt to his condition. Together, they colonized the Octies galaxy, combining Octies' wisdom with Zombus' dark resilience to create an unstoppable force.",
