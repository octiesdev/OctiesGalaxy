He lost his family and friends due to one of Joknax's failed experiments, which deeply scarred his soul. Although filled with sadness, Dolorax found purpose in helping others, striving to prevent the same tragedy from happening again. His wisdom and compassion make him an important ally, though he struggles to trust and let light back into his life. He assists Octies in the fight for peace across the galaxy while working through his own emotional wounds, hoping to find peace one day.",
