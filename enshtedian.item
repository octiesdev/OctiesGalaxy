  "description": "Enshtein, a legendary scientist and theorist, is said to have been the first human to evolve into a Neophidian using advanced technologies and anthropogenesis, possibly giving rise to the entire Octies civilization. His groundbreaking research into the fusion of quantum technology and magic revolutionized the way beings in the galaxy understood reality, allowing them to manipulate space, time, and energy at will. Beyond his monumental discoveries, Enshtein harbored a deep fascination with Octies, the first Neophidian to fully embody the perfect fusion of science and magic.",
