  "name": "Joknax",
  "description": "Joknax was once a brilliant scientist in the Octies galaxy, dedicated to the study of genetic engineering and the limits of Neophidian power. His experiments, aimed at surpassing even Neophidian evolution, led to disaster â€” his mind shattered, and he transformed into a chaotic, mad creature. His body and mind were forever altered, balancing between genius and insanity. Joknax was exiled, and his name became legend. After a long exile, he resurfaced and offered his knowledge and technology to Octies and Pavduros, though his dark and unpredictable methods pose a constant danger. Without his genius, however, their mission may be impossible.",
