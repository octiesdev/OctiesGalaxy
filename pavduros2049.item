During the event, he showcased the fusion of magic and technology to protect the future of the galaxy. However, the summit was soon targeted by adversaries aiming to disrupt the integration of these new advancements. With his unmatched abilities, Pavduros foiled the plot, proving once again his value as a protector of the Octies galaxy.",
