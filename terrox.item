  "description": "Terrox, once a notorious mercenary feared across the war-torn planets of the Octies galaxy, lived a life fueled by conflict and survival. His reputation for ruthlessness and tactical brilliance earned him many enemies and few allies. During a high-stakes mission, Terrox stumbled upon an ancient Neophidian facility hidden deep beneath the surface of a barren planet. There, he discovered powerful Neophidian technology that forever changed his body and mind. Initially, Terrox used his newfound powers to further his mercenary career, clashing with Octies and Zombus during a critical battle over a key strategic point. Though they fought on opposing sides, Octies saw potential in Terroxâ€™s abilities and offered him a chance to align with their mission to protect the galaxy.",
